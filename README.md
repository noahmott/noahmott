- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Noah Mott
I'm currently a Data Scientist working for TikTok and assigned as the Violent Extremism Lead under the Network Analysis and Targeted Manipulation Team for US Trust & Safety (that's a mouthful!). I used Data Scienct and Machine Learning Solutions to protect the users and creators on the platform!
