- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Noah Mott.
I'm a Data Scientist working for TikTok as the Violent Extremism Lead under the Network Analysis and Targeted Manipulation Team for US Trust & Safety (that's a mouthful!). I use Data Science and Machine Learning Solutions to protect the users and creators on the platform!
