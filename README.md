- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Noah Mott
I'm currently a Data Scientist with Occam Solutions where we support the US Military's Combatant Commands with Data Science solutions.
This is a working repository of Unclassified Data Projects that I've worked on across my personal, professional, and academic programs. Please take a look at your discretion!
